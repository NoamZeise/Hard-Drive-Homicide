# 2D-Vulkan-Environment
<h5>A 2D renderer for vulkan, ideal for small projects, just add rendering and update code into app.cpp </h5>

features so far:
  
* Handles loading textures and fonts
* Draw textured quads in arbitrary positions
* Draw strings using a loaded font
* Play audio on windows with a filename

# dependancies:

* vulkan sdk (i'm using 1.2.189.1) for included libs, validation layers when debugging, glsl to spirv
* GLFW handles windowing and input
* (on UNIX) only setup for X11 with glfw
* GLM handles glsl datatypes and matrix operations
* freetype2 for font loading (comes with repo)
* uses stb_image.h for image loading (comes with repo)

libs (windows only):
* freetyped.lib (included)
